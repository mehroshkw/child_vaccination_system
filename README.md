Vaccination Management System for Children (Android Application)

Project Domain / Category
Mobile Application

Abstract / Introduction
Because their immune systems have not yet developed the essential defenses to battle serious infections and diseases, young children are more susceptible to infectious diseases. For underdeveloped nations like ours, ensuring that children have access to appropriate healthcare and immunization against diseases that can be prevented by vaccines, is a very difficult task. This emphasizes the necessity of putting in place a better, wiser structure in order to improve the circumstances. With the use of this program, parents can plan immunization visits for their children while also receiving information and storing records.

With only a few clicks, parents can schedule vaccination visits for their children using our proposed Vaccination Management System. The administration will oversee the child's vaccination report and appointment permission. Hospitals will provide updates on the child's immunization application status. With this system, a lot of man-hours will be saved and it is efficient too.
